# Maputnik ❤️ OSM

A lot of hours have gone into Maputnik over the lifetime of the project. Although the initial development was funded by a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/174808720/maputnik-visual-map-editor-for-mapbox-gl), all subsequent development and maintenance has been done by a number of contributors in their free time.

If you or your organisation has seen value from Maputnik, please consider donating to <https://donate.openstreetmap.org> on behalf of the project, mentioning 'Maputnik' somewhere in the 'public message'. Something along the lines of

Or any other message that includes 'Maputnik' in the description.

Showing appreciation for Maputnik helps motivate us to continue with development. So thank you in advance for your support.

_Note:_ We'll run a script periodically to pull down the latest donations that mention Maputnik.
