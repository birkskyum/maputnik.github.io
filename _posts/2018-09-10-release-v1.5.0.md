I've just released v1.5.0. This release includes access to [Thunderforest vector tiles](https://www.thunderforest.com/docs/vector-maps-api/) from the data sources modal. A big thanks goes to [Thunderforest](https://www.thunderforest.com) for providing us an access token for use within the editor.

Other smaller fixes and features include

 - Added 'show-collision-boxes' query parameter
 - Added support for 'raster-resampling'
 - Updated mapbox dependencies

Contributions from @chriswhong and myself @orangemug. Please [raise a bug](https://github.com/maputnik/editor/issues) if you spot any issues.

Have fun mapping!
