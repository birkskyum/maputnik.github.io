I've just released v1.4.0, this release has a couple of new features and one major bug fix

 - Fixed bug that was causing the map pane to be unresponsive for some users ([#348](https://github.com/maputnik/editor/pull/348))
 - Option to download styles with your own tokens ([#345](https://github.com/maputnik/editor/pull/345))
 - Map pane no longer overflows the container, fixing zoom center ([#344](https://github.com/maputnik/editor/pull/344))
 - Disable bounce scroll on main application window ([#343](https://github.com/maputnik/editor/pull/343))
