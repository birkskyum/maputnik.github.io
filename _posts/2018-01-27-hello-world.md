Hello and welcome to the Maputnik blog. So the obvious question is why does Maputnik need a blog? This is a place to share news about the Maputnik editor and show off notable new developments. It'll also act as a place to announce major new releases and experimental features.

The aim is to communicate a little more with our users on the state of the project and what we're working on. GitHub issues is very technical and granular and the hope is the odd update on a blog over the year will help push the Maputnik editor a little better.

If you have any other ideas or want to write something for the blog, we'd be pleased to hear from you. Please open an issue and let us know what you're planning <https://github.com/maputnik/maputnik.github.io/issues>.

We now also have a twitter account, so please mention [@maputnik](https://twitter.com/maputnik) with anything you've written on your own blog.
